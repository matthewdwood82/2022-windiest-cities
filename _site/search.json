Most of the missing data is from early in the season however. Wind tends to pick up late in the fall/winter, so hopefully the missing data here does not include too many of the extreme values for which we are interested.\nAnalysis inspired by @ChrisAllenFFWXâ€™s work on weather effects and passing, e.g., this 2018 article series ."
