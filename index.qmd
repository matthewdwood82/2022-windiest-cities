Per `{nflfastR}`, during the regular season last year which home NFL outdoor stadium(s) had the fastest wind speed recorded at kickoff? 

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| echo: TRUE

library(tidyverse)
library(nflfastR)
library(DT)

df_schedule <- nflfastR::fast_scraper_schedules(2022) %>% 
  dplyr::select(game_id:gametime, away_team, home_team, location, roof, wind) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(game_type == "REG", location == "Home", roof == "outdoors") 

df_answer <- df_schedule %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(wind)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(rank = dplyr::row_number()) %>% 
  dplyr::select(rank, gameday, week, gametime, away_team, home_team, wind)

DT::datatable(df_answer, rownames = FALSE)
```
